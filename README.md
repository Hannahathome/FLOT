# FLOT
Past semester, I created a proof of concept model for the FLOT System, a two-part  toolset made to make liquid intake tracking easier and more accurate. This is the code.



To use the code for the puck, copy the entire folder into your preffered location and run arduino. Do *not* copy just the 'Puck-acc-weight" file. It will not be complete without the .h files!
